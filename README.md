# Documentation for APS360 Project (unnamed for now)
Team: Shirley, Justin, Apurva, Ryan

## Project Description
The purpose of our project is to generate anime-like characters from a portrait image of a person. Anime, also known
as Japanese animation, has gained traction specifically in Western communities. Nowadays, through the influence
of social media creators, many individuals are interested in transforming their profile photos into anime-style images
that resemble characters from their favourite animated shows. Our motivation for this project stems from the fact that
commercial image editing software falls short in achieving this style transfer that we and many others are hoping for.
Additionally, creating anime images manually in specific styles requires professional artistic skills.
In order to accomplish our goal, we can develop a deep learning model, specifically a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN), which would be capable of accurately translating features of a human face into an anime-style illustration. We
will work towards a transformation which would preserve the unique characteristics of the individual while applying
the stylistic elements and shapes of features of the given style of anime. For example, anime characters tend to have
colourful hair, small noses, and large and expressive eyes whereas human faces do not always possess these distinct
facial features. GANâ€™s are specifically good at generating high-quality images along with transferring styles between
different domains because of their architecture which involves two unique networks, a generator and a discriminator.
However, it might be less competent at shape transformation, which will be a major challenge for this project. GAN
variants such as CycleGAN and StyleGAN are excellent at style transfer tasks, and CycleGAN in particular can learn
the mapping between human faces and anime styles without needing exact pairs of corresponding images. For our
specific project, we will use a modified version of CycleGAN that incorporates data from annotated facial landmarks
to generate a more detailed anime character.
